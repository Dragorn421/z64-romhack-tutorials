# Custom Actors Examples

This lists examples of custom actors, mostly made with the [z64ovl](https://github.com/z64me/z64ovl) headers.

Titles credit the authors.

Nokaubure made a [video tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVdYKK6hPyQ).

Keep in mind that z64ovl names (such as function, structs or struct members names) change often so references are quickly broken when used with newer z64ovl versions.
