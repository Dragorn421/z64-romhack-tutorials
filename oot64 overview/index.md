This set of documents aims at introducing concepts needed to understand how some parts of Ocarina of Time 64 work.

Some parts focus on the organization in the [OoT64 decomp project](https://github.com/zeldaret/oot/) specifically. (latest revision at time of writing: [05b2cbf](https://github.com/zeldaret/oot/tree/05b2cbfc60d396a7cf3b539347fc693d5588cada))

Some details may only be true for the PAL MQ Debug version of OoT64 but most of the content here applies to other versions.

Don't worry if some parts are unclear, most stuff here is not needed to have fun modding!
That said, feedback is appreciated :)
