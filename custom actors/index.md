# Requirements

* Be able to do basic modeling (for example with Blender)

* Be able to make basic maps (for example with SharpOcarina)

* Have at least a very basic idea of how OoT's engine works

Having watched [Nokaubure's SharpOcarina tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHifXa1TzdydElLH_cSvnWIemkqJvBLDZ) parts 1 to 4 is probably a good introduction.

I recommend using recent Blender versions, like Blender 2.93. [A nice tutorial for Blender 2.80](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6) (still relevant for Blender 2.93).

Additionally, basic programming knowledge would be nice. We will be using [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). I may not go into details about C syntax on every single line, but hopefully it will be clear enough for beginners.

Let's get started!
